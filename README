A PHP project using CodeIgniter framework with an imported seeder to populate a mysql database. Once the database was populated with users I followed MVC structure to query the users and display them on the page. Also created a query to filter through all the users and show only those whose name includes ‘john’.  

Components needed:
-composer
-faker
-Seeder class
 Imported a seeder class from  Kenji Suzuki (<https://github.com/kenjis>) 

To change the amount of seeding, locate this file and change the variable amount: application/database/seeds/UsersSeeder.php and change $limit = ??? .

My Users database table has the following columns:
id 
full_name
email 
city 
created_at

Used this site to help set up seeder class to my codeigniter project: http://www.tutorials.kode-blog.com/codeigniter-migration
